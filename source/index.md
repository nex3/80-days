# 80 Days in 80 Days

It started as a joke but became a plan: racing the game [80 Days] in "real
time", where each player picks up the game once per day and stops playing once a
single in-game day has elapsed. As such, the race will last for (up to) 80
real-world days!

[80 Days]: https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/

## How to Participate

The race is open access to anyone who wants to join. To sign up, send an email
to [race@80-days-in-80-days.com] with the following information:

[race@80-days-in-80-days.com]: mailto:race@80-days-in-80-days.com

* The name you want us to use to refer to you in the standings.
* The time zone you want to play in.
* Your favorite color ([hex code preferred]).
* An emoji to represent you, or some other small icon that won't get me sued for
  copyright violation.

[hex code preferred]: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/

Once every real-time day, you may play the game until the in-game day ticks
over. Once it does, take a screenshot of your progress, then immediately save
and quit. Send the screenshot to the email above; this screenshot should include
all the information in the HUD as well as your location on the world map.

The race will use Seed 1, the seed you get if you start a totally new save game.
If you're playing on a desktop computer, you can fake a new game by renaming your
save directory (`%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Inkle Studios` if you're using
Steam on Windows) to something different while you're playing the race.

## Rules

### Winning

* You must win Fogg's wager in order to place in the race. This means you must
  arrive in London before 80 days have elapsed, with Fogg alive and accompanying
  you.

* The winner will be calculated based on how many real-world days have elapsed
  since the race began, adjusted for your time zone.

* Ties in day count will be broken by the in-game clock. If that somehow ties as
  well, we'll figure something out on the fly.

### Timing

* Don't play through more than one in-game day per real-time day. It's not
  always possible to stop exactly after midnight in-game, but stop as soon as
  you reasonably can.

* I must receive your update email during the appropriate day, according to
  whatever time zone you're playing in.

* I'll give each player has three "grace days" where they can send in their
  progress a day late along with the next day's progress. After that, late
  submissions will put you a day behind everyone else. (You don't need to
  actually spend a day doing nothing in-game though.)

### External Information

* During the race, don't consult the 80 Days wiki or other sources of game
  information other than what's available in-game, or what's listed on this
  page.

* You *may* share information you've come across in-game with other racers, if
  you so choose.

* I can't stop you from memorizing a bunch of wiki information beforehand, but
  come on.

### Enforcement

* There is none. It's the honor system. Why would you cheat in a friendly race
  anyway?

### Prize

* I (Natalie) will buy the winner a narrative-focused indie game of their
  choosing.

* If my wife or I win, we'll give the prize to the next runner-up.
