# 80 Days in 80 Days

It started as a joke but became a plan: racing the game [80 Days] in "real
time", where each player picks up the game once per day and stops playing once a
single in-game day has elapsed. As such, the race will last for (up to) 80
real-world days!

## How to Run the Race

Every day, you should play through about one day of in-game time and then send a
screenshot of your game state to [race@80-days-in-80-days.com]. This screenshot
should include **your position on the world map and all the information on your
HUD**.

[race@80-days-in-80-days.com]: mailto:race@80-days-in-80-days.com

The game should autosave at 10pm every day, so just after 10pm on the current
day will often be the best time to take a screenshot and quit out. However, I'll
allow any screenshot from between 10pm on the current day and 10pm on the next
day.

If the game doesn't save at all for more than one in-game day, let me know in
your email and wait to progress further until the real-time day catches up with
your game.

## Rules

### Winning

* You must win Fogg's wager in order to place in the race. This means you must
  arrive in London before 80 days have elapsed, with Fogg alive and accompanying
  you.

* The winner will be calculated based on how many real-world days have elapsed
  since the race began, adjusted for your time zone.

* Ties in day count will be broken by the in-game clock. If that somehow ties as
  well, we'll figure something out on the fly.

### Timing

* I must receive your update email during the appropriate day, according to
  whatever time zone you're playing in.

* I'll give each player has three "grace days" where they can send in their
  progress a day late along with the next day's progress. After that, late
  submissions will put you a day behind everyone else. (You don't need to
  actually spend a day doing nothing in-game though.)

### External Information

* During the race, don't consult the 80 Days wiki or other sources of game
  information other than what's available in-game, or what's listed on this
  page.

* You *may* share information you've come across in-game with other racers, if
  you so choose.

* I can't stop you from memorizing a bunch of wiki information beforehand, but
  come on.

### Enforcement

* There is none. It's the honor system. Why would you cheat in a friendly race
  anyway?

### Prize

* **Grand prize**: I (Natalie) will buy the winner a narrative-focused indie
  game of their choosing.

* **Second prize**: I'll buy the second person to return to London a
  narrative-focused indie game of their choosing worth $20 or less from
  [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/store/tag-narrative).

* **Third prize**: I'll buy the third person to return to London a
  narrative-focused indie game of their choosing worth $10 or less from
  [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/store/tag-narrative).

* If my wife or I win, we'll give the prize to the next runner-up.

## Tips & Tricks

* **Time is ticking:** Time will pass at about one minute per second when you're
  in town, even if you're looking at the map. It'll pass even faster if you're
  browsing at the market. If you're feeling pressed for time, quickly check the
  information you need and then pause the game to make your decisions.

* **Departure times:** Every mode of travel from one city to the next has a
  departure time, but you'll need to actually click on the Embark button to see
  them. Don't worry, there's a separate confirmation before you actually leave!

* **Get some cash**: Money is one of the fundamental resources, and the £4,000
  you start with won't last you your journey. You can buy and sell items in the
  market, often for very substantial profits. Once you've got around £10,000,
  though, you can probably avoid going out of your way to earn more. Try to
  avoid relying on banks in the cities you visit, since they'll take multiple
  days to provide you cash.

* **Pack lightly**: Extra suitcases aren't very expensive, but you can only
  carry so many with you on different modes of transportation. That said, you
  can often spend a few extra pounds to buy some extra luggage room.

* **Many ways forward**: Don't feel obligated to head due east all the time. The
  game has ways of making up lost time if you go exploring.
